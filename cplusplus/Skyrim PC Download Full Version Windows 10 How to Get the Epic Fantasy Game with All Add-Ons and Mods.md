1. Choose your edition. Skyrim has two main editions available for PC: the Special Edition and the Anniversary Edition. The Special Edition includes the base game and all three official add-ons: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn. It also features remastered graphics and effects, as well as support for mods. The Anniversary Edition includes everything in the Special Edition, plus new and pre-existing Creation Club content like quests, weapons, spells, and more. You can buy either edition from the Epic Games Store[^1^] or Steam[^2^], or upgrade from the Special Edition to the Anniversary Edition if you already own it.
2. Download and install the game. Once you have purchased your preferred edition, you can download and install it on your PC. You will need a minimum of 12 GB of free disk space and Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit version) to run the game. You will also need an account for either Epic Games or Steam, depending on where you bought the game from.
3. Launch and play the game. After the installation is complete, you can launch the game from your desktop or library. You will be greeted by a menu where you can customize your settings, start a new game, load a previous save, or access mods or Creation Club content. Once you start a new game, you will be able to create your own character and choose your race, gender, appearance, and name. Then, you will begin your adventure in Skyrim as a prisoner who escapes from a dragon attack.

That's it! You are now ready to enjoy Skyrim on your PC. Have fun exploring, fighting, crafting, and discovering the secrets of this amazing world.
  
Skyrim is a game that offers endless possibilities for your playstyle. You can choose from various skills, perks, and abilities to customize your character and make them stronger. You can also join different factions, such as the Companions, the Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, or the College of Winterhold, and complete their quests and challenges. You can even become a werewolf or a vampire if you want to.
 
Another feature that makes Skyrim unique is the presence of dragons. These majestic creatures are the main threat and the main attraction of the game. You will encounter them randomly as you travel across the land, and you will have to fight them with your weapons, magic, or shouts. Shouts are special powers that you can learn from ancient words carved on walls or taught by the Greybeards, a group of monks who live on the highest mountain in Skyrim. As you defeat more dragons, you will absorb their souls and use them to unlock new shouts.

One of the most important aspects of Skyrim is the modding community. Mods are user-created content that can enhance or change the game in various ways. You can find mods for almost anything you can imagine: new quests, new locations, new weapons, new armor, new characters, new graphics, new gameplay features, and more. Mods can make your game more fun, more challenging, more immersive, or more hilarious. You can download and install mods from various websites or platforms, such as Nexus Mods, Steam Workshop, or Creation Club. However, you should always be careful when using mods and backup your save files before installing them.
