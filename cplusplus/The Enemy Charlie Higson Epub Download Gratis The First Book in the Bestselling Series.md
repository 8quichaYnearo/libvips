If you are a fan of Charlie Higson's Young Bond novels, you might be interested in the UK Large Print editions that were released by Galaxy Plus. These editions feature larger fonts and more spacious layouts for easier reading. They also have different cover designs than the regular UK editions, which make them more appealing to collectors. For example, Hurricane Gold has a stunning cover that shows a crocodile attacking Bond in a swamp. The regular UK paperback had a shiny gold cover that made it hard to see the details of the artwork. But in the Large Print edition, the crocodile is clearly visible and menacing. Another difference is that SilverFin uses the cover art from the UK proof copy, which is different from the final UK paperback. And By Royal Command uses the cover art from the UK hardcover, which is more elegant than the paperback. These five books form a nice set that showcases the variety and quality of Higson's Young Bond series.
