# How to Download MPLAB XC32 Keygen for Free
 
If you are looking for a way to download MPLAB XC32 keygen for free, you might be disappointed to know that there is no such thing as a legitimate keygen for this compiler. MPLAB XC32 is a comprehensive solution for developing software for 32-bit PIC and SAM microcontrollers and microprocessors featuring Arm and MIPS cores[^1^]. It offers various optimization levels and license options to suit your needs.
 
However, using a keygen to activate a PRO license for MPLAB XC32 is illegal and unethical. It violates the terms and conditions of Microchip Technology, the developer of MPLAB XC32. It also exposes your computer to malware and viruses that might be hidden in the keygen file. Moreover, it deprives you of the benefits of using a genuine license, such as technical support, updates, and bug fixes.

Therefore, we strongly advise you to avoid downloading MPLAB XC32 keygen from any source. Instead, you can use the free version of MPLAB XC32 that comes with most of the optimizations you need to reduce your code size and increase efficiency[^1^]. You can also try the PRO license for free for 60 days by activating it in the compiler[^1^]. If you are satisfied with the performance and features of the PRO license, you can purchase it from Microchip Technology or its authorized distributors.
 
By doing so, you will not only support the development of MPLAB XC32, but also ensure that your software projects are secure and reliable. You will also be able to use the latest version of MPLAB XC32 that is compatible with Catalina[^1^] and other operating systems. You will also be able to access other tools and resources from Microchip Technology, such as MPLAB X IDE, MPLAB Analysis Tool Suite, and MPLAB Harmony[^2^].
