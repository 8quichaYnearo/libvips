# Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness - A Rare and Exciting Game for GameCube Fans
 
Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness is a role-playing game for the Nintendo GameCube that was released in Japan in 2005. It is a sequel to Pokemon Colosseum, and features a darker and more mature storyline than the main series games. The game revolves around the protagonist's quest to purify Shadow Pokemon, which are corrupted by an evil organization called Cipher.
 
The game is notable for being one of the few Pokemon games that are region-locked, meaning that it can only be played on a GameCube console with the same region code as the game disc. The game was released in three regions: NTSC-U (North America), PAL (Europe and Australia), and NTSC-J (Japan). The NTSC-J version of the game has some differences from the other versions, such as different names for some characters and locations, different music tracks, and different Shadow Pokemon encounters.

It can be found on online platforms such as eBay or Amazon, but it usually comes with a high price tag.

Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness is a unique and exciting game for GameCube fans who enjoy a darker and more challenging Pokemon adventure. It offers a rich and immersive story, stunning graphics, and engaging gameplay. It is a game that deserves to be played by anyone who loves Pokemon.
  
The gameplay of Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness is similar to other Pokemon games, but with some key differences. The player takes on the role of a young trainer who sets out to stop Cipher and save the corrupted Pokemon. Unlike other Pokemon games, the player starts with a pre-selected team of Pokemon instead of catching them in the wild. The player can also customize their Pokemon's appearance and personality using items called Poke Snacks.

The main feature of the game is the ability to snag Shadow Pokemon from enemy trainers using a device called the Snag Machine. Shadow Pokemon are dark and aggressive versions of normal Pokemon that have been artificially altered by Cipher. The player can purify Shadow Pokemon by using various methods, such as walking with them, battling with them, or placing them in special chambers. Purifying Shadow Pokemon restores their original moves and abilities, and allows them to level up and evolve normally.
 
The game also features a number of side quests and mini-games that the player can complete for rewards and bonuses. Some of these include battling in the Colosseum, participating in the Battle Bingo, and exploring the Orre region. The game also has a multiplayer mode that allows the player to battle against other players using their own GameCube memory cards or Game Boy Advance games.
